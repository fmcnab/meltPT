The scripts and datasets contained here will allow you to recreate the analyses
presented in:

* M<sup>c</sup>Nab, F. and Ball, P. W. (2023), ``meltPT``: A ``Python`` package
  for basaltic whole-rock thermobarometric analysis with application to Hawai'i,
  *Volcanica*, 6(1), p. 63&ndash;76, [doi: 10.30909/vol.06.01.6376](https://doi.org/10.30909/vol.06.01.6376).

To work, the code needs to be run with **meltPT** v1.2.0. To install this
specfic version, follow the installation instructions in the main README with
the following adaption to the ``pip install`` command:

```
$ pip install meltPT==1.2.0
```
