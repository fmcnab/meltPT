Installation

---------
Linux/Mac

We recommend running **meltPT** in a virtual environment. Start a terminal and enter:

.. code-block:: console

  $ # Create virtual environment.
  $ # Replace /path/to/virtual/environment with your desired path.
  $ python3 -m venv /path/to/virtual/environment

  $ # Activate new virtual environment.
  $ source /path/to/virtual/environment/bin/activate

Next, download the code. Navigate to your desired location and type:

.. code-block:: console

  $ git clone git@github.com:fmcnab/meltPT.git

You should now have a directory called "meltPT". To install the package, enter this directory and run the setup script:

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd meltPT
  $ python3 setup.py install

This will take a minute or two and print lots of stuff. If it completes successfully, you are now ready to use **meltPT**!

Unfortunately, we don't know much about using Python on a Windows system. But we will find out!
