Thermobarometers
^^^^^

This list documents the thermobarometers, thermometers and barometers currently implemented within **meltPT**. To use each option, the abbreviated name at the beginning of each option can be typed within the method flag of compute_pressure_temperature(), compute_temperature() and/or compute_pressure(). The associated equation names in the list below refer to the equations in the original papers. See the code documentation for more details.
