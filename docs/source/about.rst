==========
Background
==========

**meltPT** is a Python package for whole-rock major-element themormobarometric
analyses of basaltic (mafic) rocks. It contains modules for:

*  Correcting sample compositions for effects of olivine crystallisation
*  Estimating pressures and temperatures at which samples were last in
   equilibrium with the mantle
*  Estimating melt fractions and potential temperatures on an individual basis
   or for a suite of samples

Citing meltPT
=============

If you use our code, please cite us. Currently each **meltPT** release is
archived in our Zenodo repository:

*  M\ :sup:`c`\ Nab, F. and Ball, P. W. (2022), meltPT, version 1.0.1,
   *Zenodo*, `doi: 10.5281/zenodo.6948030 <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6948030>`_.

Please be sure to include the version number of the code you used, so that
others can reproduce your results. We are working on an accompanying
publication which we hope will be available soon.

We also urge you to cite the original literature on which our code is based.
The sample backtracking method is based on that of 
`Lee et al. (2009, EPSL) <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2008.12.020>`_. For
a list of themormobarometric schemes available in **meltPT**, and links to the
original papers, see the :doc:`thermobarometers` section.

If you use our melt-path fitting routines you should also cite:
