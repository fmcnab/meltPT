Background
==========

**meltPT** is a Python package for whole-rock major-element themormobarometric analyses of basaltic (mafic) rocks. It contains modules for:

* Correcting sample compositions for effects of olivine crystallisation
* Estimating pressures and temperatures at which samples were last in equilibrium with the mantle
* Estimating melt fractions and potential temperatures on an individual basis or for a suite of samples
